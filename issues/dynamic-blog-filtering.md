# Dynamic Blog Filtering and Search Feature

## Description
Enhance the existing markdown-based blog system with dynamic filtering, searching, and sorting capabilities while maintaining the current static generation approach. This will provide users with better discovery and navigation of blog content without requiring a database or complex CMS.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Tag-based filtering**: Click on tags to filter posts by technology or topic
- **Text search**: Search through post titles, excerpts, and tags
- **Sorting options**: Sort by date (newest/oldest), title (A-Z/Z-A)
- **URL state management**: Shareable filtered URLs with search parameters
- **Clear filters**: Easy way to reset all filters and see all posts

### User Experience
- **Real-time filtering**: Instant results as users type or select filters
- **Filter indicators**: Show active filters and result counts
- **Responsive design**: Touch-friendly filtering on mobile devices
- **Loading states**: Smooth transitions during filtering
- **Empty states**: Helpful messaging when no posts match filters

### Technical Implementation
- **Client-side filtering**: Fast filtering using React state management
- **URL synchronization**: Sync filter state with browser URL for shareability  
- **Enhanced blog utilities**: Extend existing `src/lib/blog.ts` with filtering functions
- **Component architecture**: Reusable filter components
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient filtering algorithms for fast response

## Features to Add

### 1. Enhanced Blog Utilities
- `getAllTags()`: Get all unique tags with post counts
- `filterPostsByTag(posts, tag)`: Filter posts by specific tag
- `searchPosts(posts, query)`: Search posts by title, excerpt, and tags
- `sortPosts(posts, sortBy, order)`: Sort posts by various criteria
- `getTagCounts()`: Count posts per tag for display

### 2. Filter Components
- **TagFilter**: Clickable tag chips that toggle filtering
- **SearchBar**: Text input with search icon and clear functionality
- **SortDropdown**: Dropdown menu for sorting options
- **ActiveFilters**: Show currently applied filters with remove buttons
- **ResultsCount**: Display "Showing X of Y posts" information

### 3. Enhanced Blog Index Page
- **Filter toolbar**: Search, tag filter, and sort controls at the top
- **Filtered post display**: Show filtered results with smooth animations
- **Filter persistence**: Maintain filters in URL for sharing/bookmarking
- **Mobile optimization**: Collapsible filter panel on smaller screens

### 4. Tag Management
- **Tag normalization**: Consistent tag formatting and casing
- **Tag suggestions**: Show popular tags for easier discovery
- **Tag hierarchy**: Support for nested or related tags (future)

## User Stories

### As a blog visitor, I want to:
- Filter posts by technology tags (React, Next.js, Rails, etc.)
- Search for posts about specific topics or technologies
- Sort posts by date or title to find what I'm looking for
- Share filtered blog URLs with others
- Easily clear all filters to see all posts

### As a blog author, I want to:
- See which tags are most popular with readers
- Ensure consistent tag formatting across posts
- Have tags automatically suggest related content

## Technical Architecture

### URL Structure
- `/blog` - All posts (default view)
- `/blog?tag=Next.js` - Posts tagged with Next.js
- `/blog?search=authentication` - Posts containing "authentication"
- `/blog?tag=Rails&sort=title&order=asc` - Combined filters and sorting
- `/blog?tag=Chi War&tag=authentication` - Multiple tag filtering

### Component Hierarchy
```
BlogPage
├── FilterToolbar
│   ├── SearchBar
│   ├── TagFilter
│   └── SortDropdown
├── ActiveFilters
├── ResultsCount
└── PostList
    └── PostCard (existing)
```

### State Management
- Use Next.js `useSearchParams` for URL state synchronization
- React state for immediate UI updates
- Debounced search for performance
- Local storage for user preferences (optional)
